TELNET ECHO FIX APPLIED
======================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Evennia wasn't sending the "IAC WILL ECHO" command during telnet negotiation.
This caused telnet clients to not see what they were typing.

BEFORE FIX:
- Server sent various telnet options but not ECHO
- Client kept local echo on (characters not visible when typing)

AFTER FIX:
- Server now sends "IAC WILL 1 (ECHO)" during connection
- This tells the client that the server will handle echoing
- Client should turn off local echo and let server echo back characters

SOLUTION APPLIED:
- Created custom TelnetProtocol in /app/server/conf/fix_telnet_echo.py
- Added TELNET_PROTOCOL_CLASS setting to use the custom protocol
- Custom protocol forces sending "IAC WILL ECHO" on connection

CONNECTION INFO:
- Telnet: localhost:4000 (should now show what you type)
- Web: http://localhost:4001 (browser)
- WebSocket: ws://localhost:4002

TEST ACCOUNTS:
Two test accounts were created previously (credentials not stored here for security).

The telnet echo bug has been fixed. You should now be able to see what you 
type when connecting via telnet to localhost:4000.
